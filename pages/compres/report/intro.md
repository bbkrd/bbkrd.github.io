#### Creating HTML output

A summary of the quality measures can be saved in a HTML report. The following ways are possible.

{: .table .table-bordered}
| *Selection of SA-items* | Select SA-item(s), right mouse click and select "Create HTMLs"|
| *Selection of Multidocuments*| $\text{Tools}  \rhd \text{Create HTML for selected multi-documents}$|
| *All Multidocuments*| $\text{Tools}  \rhd \text{Create HTML for all multi-documents}$|


The folder in which the reports are saved can be specified by the user. The name of the HTML report is identical to the workspace or the SA-item name depending on the chosen output option. Should an HTML report with the same name already exist, a new name has to be chosen.


#### Options

Under $\text{Tools} \rhd \text{Options} \rhd \text{Demetra} \rhd \text{CompResReport}$ you can find several options to customise your report.

{: .table .table-bordered}
| *Auto correlation zoom* | Describes the maximum value for the auto correlation graph. The graph will be between 0 and this value. | 	
| *Decimal places in tables* | The number of digits printed in the html report. | 	
| *Tables timespan* | Timespan of tables in the report in years | 
| *Graphics timespan* | Timespan of graphics in the report in years | 	
| *Html count* | Either choose to create one or several html files for the items. | 	
| *Report style* | More detailed descriptions for each style can be found on their individual pages. |
