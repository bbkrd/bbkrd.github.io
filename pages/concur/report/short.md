The HTML report is a short summary for the comparison of current and partial concurrent adjusted series that is split into two parts which broadly result in two DIN-A-4 pages if printed out (The HTML report contains SVG graphics. It may be possible that your PDF creator does not support this format). The first part of the report summarises the specifications and the regARIMA results, the second part contains results concerning the X-11 results and the quality of the final seasonal adjustment.

The HTML documents contain the following information.

<table class="table table-bordered">
